Rusty nails
In tender skin
In calloused hands of man
Penning all that is so good
Onto pieces of wood

It was blood that came pouring down
From a holy crown
Blood that was shed for me

Hallelujah
The heavens will ring
Hallelujah
Creation will sing
Praise to the king
Hallelujah

Rusty nails
In tender skin
In calloused hands of man
Penning all that is so good

Hallelujah
The heavens will ring
Hallelujah
Creation will sing
Praise to the king

Hallelujah
In every town
Hallelujah
Salvation has come
From the glorious one
Hallelujah

Empty grave
Where our king was laid
Forever our world was changed
So let your children sing

Hallelujah
The heavens will ring
Hallelujah
Creation will sing
Praise to the king

Hallelujah
In every town
Hallelujah
Salvation has come
From the glorious one
Hallelujah

Hallelujah
