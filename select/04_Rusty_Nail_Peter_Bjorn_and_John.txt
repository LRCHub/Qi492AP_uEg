I can't stop, forgot
Now it's nothing but a, a hard knot
I keep thinking of it
I can't stop and now it's all my life

I knew something but it's all wrong
I had answers but they're all gone
But I keep working on it
I can't stop and now it's all my life

I keep getting that rusty nail again all the time
I had dreams I had dreams where I wanna be
All my life
I never knew how much it meant to me
All the time
I had dreams I had dreams where I wanna be
All my life

I keep getting that rusty nail again all my life

A self taught, soft spot
Now I know I tried it full stop
Didn't know about it but I know I like it all my life
I'm tangled up now I know it's never just black or white
I can't stop now, it's gonna be all my life

I keep getting that rusty nail again all the time
I had dreams I had dreams where I wanna be
All my life
I never knew how much it meant to me
All the time
I had dreams I had dreams where I wanna be
All my life

I keep getting that rusty nail again all the time
I keep getting that rusty nail again all my life

I keep getting that rusty nail again all the time
I keep getting that rusty nail again all my life
