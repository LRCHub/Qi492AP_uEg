I broke my back just for her
I got off track, now that’s for sure
I used to give her my money,
I’d tell you no lie
It cost me 20 dollars
every time she’d cry
but I don’t care no more
cause she aint mine
and that rusty nail
gave me a thrill
that rusty nail
do me like she never will
well I know there’s another man
that she found
cause the only time she’s loving
is when I ain’t around and
that nail gonna nail me in the ground
sometimes it’s raining
sometimes it aint
sometimes I’m changing
sometimes I can’t
sometimes im right, sometimes im wrong
most times I feel like I just don’t belong
but the whole time I stay here all night long
and that rusty nail
kissed me goodnight
took all my money,
turned out the light
well I had a little girl, but she aint around
my nerves are scattered and I come unwound
and that nail gonna nail me in the ground
